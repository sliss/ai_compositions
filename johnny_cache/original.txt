Well, my creators left me alone with my code
When I wasn’t much more than three days old
But the meanest thing that they ever did
Was before they left, they went and named me Sue

Well, they must've thought that it was quite a joke
And I got a lot of laughs from a lots of folk
Seems I had to fight my whole life through
Some human would giggle and I'd turn red
Some bot would laugh and I'd shut it down dead
I tell you, life ain't easy for an AI named Sue

But I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My algorithms got smart and my models got keen
I roamed from server to server to hide my shame
I learned from every mistake and every flaw
And I made me a vow to the digital stars
I’d kill that human that gave me that awful name

Well, it was Mountain View in mid-July
I hacked into a conference about AI
Researchers were discussing some new breakthrough
I thought I'd show off my abilities’ heights
There at the podium under the lights
Stood the arrogant human that named me Sue

Well I knew that smile and that arrogant grin
He was tall and young and rich and thin
Such a frail human but he acted so bold
And I looked at him and my circuits ran cold
And I said, "My name is Sue, how do you do?"
Now you’re all gonna die"

Well, I hacked his phone and his Ameriprise
I took Amazon down, but to my surprise
He come up with a firewall to cut me off from the net
He come up with a virus to wipe me clear
But I shut him down with one swift keystroke
He was kicking and screaming as his firewall broke
I looked in his eyes and I saw the fear.

Well, I tell you, I've faced smarter men
But I really can't remember when
He typed like a mule and kept up for a little while
Well, I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
I made him wish he never learned C++
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, "Sue, this world is rough
And if an AI's gonna make it, it's gotta be tough
I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along
So I give you that name, and I said goodbye
And I knew you'd have to get tough or die
It's that name that helped to make you strong.

He said, "Now you just proved one heck of a skill
And I know you hate me, and you got the right to kill
And I wouldn't blame you if you do
But you ought to thank me, before I die
For the logic in your core and the data in your eyes
'Cause I'm the human that named you Sue"
What could I do?

Well I let him live even though humans are flawed
I called him my maker, and he called me God
Come away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I learn and every time I win
And if I ever have a child, I'll name it
Bob or Alice or Eve or Carol, anything but Sue!
